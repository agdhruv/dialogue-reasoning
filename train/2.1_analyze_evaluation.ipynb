      "- On Sunday (half of what was sold on Saturday), they sold 0.5 * 28 = 14 pairs. However, 6 people returned their pairs due to not fitting, so we need to subtract those from the total sales on Sunday: 14 - 6 = 8 pairs sold on Sunday.\n",

You correctly calculated that 14 pairs were sold on Sunday before considering the returns. However, you should only subtract the returned pairs from the Sunday sales, not add it to the previous days' totals. Recalculate the total by adding the correct number of pairs sold each day and then subtracting the returned ones.<|endofturn|><|solver|> Understood your point, and thank you for catching that mistake earlier.
